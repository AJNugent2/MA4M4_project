Running the MATLAB script compare_models reproduces all necessary figures and results. This script will call all other functions except 
plot_node_behaviour_vertically which only serves to reformat the node behaviour plot. 

create_empirical_network imports and format the empirical network. Other create_ files can be used to realise random network models.
